# Burp Suite Free
## TheHCS / @NitescuLucian / https://portswigger.net/

As you might know Burp Suite comes in two different flavour, the Free and Pro. In this article we are going to discuss only about the free version of Burp Suite.

What Burp Suite Free can do:

* Automated crawl and scan (without the automated vulnerability scanner)
* Clear and detailed presentation of vulnerabilities (of your manual identified vulnerabilities)
* Intercept and modify browser traffic using man-in-the-middle proxy
* Advanced manual testing tools (and only manual)
* Extensibility (you can program your own module and add it to your Burp making it a perfect scanner)

Why on earth I would use the free version?

* If I don't have the money
* If I need to test something manually (prove a point)
* It is present in different OS's, Frameworks and Tool Bundles (Ex: Kali or Pentestbox)
