Maltego CE is the community version of Maltego that is available for free after a quick online registration. Maltego CE includes most of the same functionality as the commercial version however it has some limitations. The main limitation with the community version is that the application cannot be used for commercial purposes and there is also a limitation on the maximum number of entities that can be returned from a single transform. In the community version of Maltego there is no graph export functionality that is availalbe in the commercial versions.
