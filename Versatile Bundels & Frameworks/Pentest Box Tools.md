# Pentest Box Tools
## TheHCS / @NitescuLucian / https://pentestbox.org/

PentestBox is not like any other linux pentesting distribution which either runs in a virtual machine or on a dual boot envrionment.
It essentially provides all the security tools as a software package and lets you run them natively on Windows. This effectively eliminates the requirement of virtual machines or dualboot environments on windows.
It was created because more than 50% of penetration testing distribution users use virtual machines to run those distributions on the Windows operating system.

What are the strong points of Pentest Box?
* Easy to Use - It is a simple command line utility.
* Simple Design - The traditional green on black terminal comes with a modern twist.
* Performance - PentestBox runs directly on host machines instead of relying on virtual machines, bringing obvious upgrades in performance.
* No Dependencies Required - All the dependencies required by tools are inside PentestBox, so you can even run PentestBox on freshly installed windows without any hassle.
* Portable - PentestBox is entirely portable, so now you can carry your own Penetration Testing Environment on a USB stick. It will take care of all dependencies and configuration required to run tools.
* Linux Utilities - PentestBox contains nearly all linux utilities like bash, cat, chmod, curl, git, gzip, ls, mv, ps, ssh, sh, uname and others. It even contains your favourite text editor "vim". For complete list, please look at
* No Drivers Issue - Windows already has a large support of drivers for graphics cards and wireless systems, so now you wont have to worry about driver compatibility issues. For example- now you could use your GPU power to crack hashes using project RainbowCrack, which is not compatible on an environment like Linux.
* Modular - In the making of PentestBox we have included only the best tools , but in that process we might have missed some tools which you might want to use. In that case you can easily install those tools using toolsmanager present inside PentestBox, it can install/update/Uninstall tools which are not already there in PentestBox.
* Less Memory Usage - PentestBox runs on the host machine without any need for a virtual machine. So it only need's 20 MB for launching compared to atleast 2GB of RAM need for running virtual machine distributions.
* Less Disk Usage - It is very light on the Disk as well, it requires less than a third of what linux pentesting distro does.
* Inbuilt Browser - PentestBox contains a version of Mozilla Firefox Browser with nearly all its security addons. To know the complete list of addons, please click here.
* Can be shared on Network - Consider an environment where you wanted to use PentestBox on many computers at the office, lab, etc. Instead of installing PentestBox on each and every computer, you can just install it on one computer and share that folder as a drive to the other computers on the same network.

If you have a Windows PC you can use PentestBox with Metasploit as your main choice in a penetration testing.
