# Hydra

When you need to brute force crack a remote authentication service, Hydra is often the tool of choice. It can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 protocols, including telnet, ftp, http, https, smb, several databases, and much more.

Brute force will take the list that the hacker built and will likely combine it with other known (easy passwords, such as ‘password1, password2’ etc) and begin the attack. Depending on the processing speed of the hackers (auditors) computer, Internet connection (and perhaps proxies) the brute force methodology will systematically go through each password until the correct one is discovered.
