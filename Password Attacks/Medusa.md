#Medusa

Medusa is a network authentication brute-forcing tool. 
It supports a wide array of protocols including FTP, HTTP, SSH, SMB, VNC, POP3, IMAP, MySQL, Telnet and many more. The factor differentiating Medusa is its capability of testing multiple systems in parallel. Medusa achieves this feat through the multithreading directive called ‘pthreads’. Users can specify a list of hosts that are to be tested and Medusa will create a child process for every host and test multiple systems at once leveraging preemptive multitasking to the fullest.
